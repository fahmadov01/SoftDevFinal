**1) Application Description**
This application is an all in one news source application where a user can create a profile, choose specific categories of what news they are interested in, and based on that the site will show them news stories based on their selected interests. The application will connect to external API’s that will bring the news stories to them. Furthermore, the user can also put comments on the news story and also rate the news story based on how much they like or dislike it. 
	When a user opens the website, they will first be prompted to login. If they don’t have an account, they will be redirected to create one. Creating an account consists of choosing a username and password, as well as their interests. There is a home page that displays the news stories, and clicking on the story will show the news article as well as a comments section where the user can comment on. Finally, there will be a rating system on the news article where users can place their review as well as see other peoples reviews.
